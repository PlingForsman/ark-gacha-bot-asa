"""The desktop app: one fixed-size window, a sidebar, and three pages.

Read in this order - the file is laid out the same way:

    drawing helpers   draw_rounded_rect / draw_accent_strip and friends, the
                      canvas primitives every card is built out of
    reusable widgets  StatCard, ControlCard, SidebarButton, LegendChip, and
                      DashboardLogHandler (the bridge from logger.py)
    DashboardPage     bot control, live counts, the Event Log
    FormPage          shared scaffolding for the two form-shaped pages
    SettingsPage      settings.json behind a second category rail, autosaved
    SupportPage       versions, log paths, and the debug snapshot users paste
                      into Discord when reporting something
    UI                the window itself: sidebar plus the three pages

Things that will bite you if you don't know them:

  - CTk's automatic DPI scaling is turned off at import (see the note below
    ctk.deactivate_automatic_dpi_awareness). Every size in this file is a
    literal pixel, and font sizes are given negative so Tk reads them as
    pixels too rather than points.
  - The window is fixed-size and non-resizable, and the dashboard's column
    widths are computed once from that (CARD_W) instead of being left to
    Tk's grid - see the note above _CONTENT_W for what went wrong when they
    weren't.
  - Anywhere a card needs a rounded corner or an accent strip, it's drawn on
    a tk.Canvas rather than assembled from CTk widgets. The comments on
    StatCard and draw_accent_strip explain what CTk couldn't do here; both
    describe approaches that were tried and failed, so they're worth reading
    before "simplifying" either.
  - The three pages are stacked in one grid cell and swapped with tkraise(),
    so all three exist from startup - only one is drawn.

Colors and the font live in UI/theme.py; nothing here should hardcode a hex
value.
