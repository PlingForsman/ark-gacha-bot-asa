"""The app's one logger, importable from anywhere as `from logger.logger
import logger`.

Everything written through it lands in logger/logs.log, and - once the
dashboard is up - in the on-screen Event Log too, because DashboardPage
attaches a handler to this same logger (see UI.DashboardLogHandler). Code in
the bot doesn't need to know the UI exists; it just logs.

Set up the moment this module is imported:

  - Each launch starts a fresh logs.log, and the previous run is kept beside
    it under the date it was written - logs_2026-07-28_14-52-31.log - back to
    KEPT_RUNS of them. A user who restarts the app before reporting a bug
    still has the log that matters, and can tell which one it is.
  - Crashes are logged, with their full traceback, from all three places
    this app can die: the main thread (sys.excepthook), a worker thread
    (threading.excepthook) and a Tk callback (Tk.report_callback_exception).
    Tk in particular catches exceptions itself and would otherwise swallow
    them, which covers every button press and every `after` job - so most of
    the app.

Ctrl-C is not treated as a crash; it goes to Python's own handler and is not
logged.
